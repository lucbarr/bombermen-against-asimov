# Artificial Intelligences

In this directory, you can code your own AI to play against other AI in the field of play. It must be an abstraction
from Intel class in src. This means it has to have a setBomb() and a step() functions, which names are self explanatory.
You can design it however the hell you want, you can add many other methods to calculate these things, you can define
the calculations inside the main methods, you can just stare at this code and try to comprehend it, you can swear me
for coding poorly... Be firee and let your mind be it as well!
